Assign categories to all income/expenses

My transactions occur with accounts in 2 banks - credit cards/ checking/ savigns accounts. 
The purpose of this code is to run it every month to assign categories to my transactions.

A lof of my transactions happen at regular places so I have created two word mapping files which is basically to lookup a word/string and match it to the right category.

Ex: The "general category" will have words such as Resta/Food/Drink/pizza/Bar and allot any transactions containing these strings to "Food & Drinks". 

The "specific category" has very specific words which is based on my transaction history. You can create your own if you'd like. 

Steps - 

1) Download the bank statements.
2) Update your category mapping files.
3) Update the code to read your bank statements correctly. (I have specific numbers as identification for different accounts. You can use yours) (ONE TIME ONLY)
3) Run the code!

This isn't right out of the box code so you will have to make quite some of changes according to your bank statements!

I will try to add some comments where change will be required in the code.
